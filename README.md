## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the primary factors that influence game sales on Steam. By leveraging multiple data sources and applying advanced data processing techniques, we build a robust multi-linear regression model to predict game sales and understand the key determinants.

## Data Collection
Data is collected from the following sources:
- **Steam API**: Provides game IDs and names.
- **SteamSpy API**: Offers various game metrics such as ratings and reviews.
- **SteamHF Dataset**: Includes additional information like genres, categories, and tags.
- **Gamalytic API**: Supplies publisher class and copies sold data.

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing values are handled using appropriate imputation strategies.
- Numerical features are scaled, and categorical features are encoded.
- Data is split into training and test sets to ensure model robustness.

## Model Building
- A multi-linear regression model is built using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most impactful features.
- The selected features include positive reviews, negative reviews, price, Metacritic score, recommendations, current users, peak users, and publisher class.

## Evaluation
- The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
- Residuals are analyzed for normality and variance to validate model assumptions.

## Results
- Positive reviews have the largest positive impact on sales.
- Recommendations is also significant predictors.
- Surprisingly, the price does not have a strong influence on sales.
